This is a little PHP exercise used to demonstrate reading/printing rows from a CSV to a web page.

The CSV contains rows of cars: their model, make, year, and number of engine cylinders.

The PHP function loads the CSV, and iterates through the rows, printing each record out into an HTML table. It also creates a Google Image Search query by combining values from each column into a clickable link.
